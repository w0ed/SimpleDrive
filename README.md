SimpleDrive is designed to create and manage files in both local storage and S3 buckets. It allows users to save and retrieve Base64-encoded messages as files, demonstrating flexible storage options and seamless integration between different storage backends.
I have implemented data-saving functionality for both local storage and S3 buckets. The local storage functionality works as expected, storing files in a specified directory, while the S3 service requires further configuration to resolve the issue with the required URL.
The project includes a dedicated service for S3, which you can review. I have also configured Dependency Injection (DI) to register the local storage service, passing the StoragePath defined in appsettings.json to save files in the specified directory.
